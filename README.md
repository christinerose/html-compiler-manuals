# html-compiler-manuals
HTML pages for the OCaml compiler manuals for the different OCaml versions - these are served by OCaml.org

## Structure of the Repository

For every compiler version, a folder exists that contain the HTML manual pages to be served by OCaml.org.

The compiler manual HTML pages will be checked out by OCaml.org's Dockerfile and served as static files.
